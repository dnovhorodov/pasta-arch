> **PASTA** ‚Äî _PortsüîπAdaptersüîπSlicesüîπTyped Abstractionsüîπ(Anti-Layers)_

A minimalist, modern architecture for building modular, testable, and maintainable systems in C#, with:
- No interfaces.
- No anemic layers.
- No framework-driven indirection.

Just functional slices of real business logic, with typed ports and clean boundaries.

> Each use case forms a **vertical slice**: its own logic, ports, and orchestration.  
> No split projects per "layer". Functional cohesion lives within the slice.

## üí° Key Concepts

| Component            | Role                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case (Slice)** | Self-contained unit: handler, ports, business logic             |
| **Input Adapter**    | Accepts external input (HTTP, CLI, etc.), calls port delegate   |
| **Output Adapter**   | Implements outbound ports (DB, Email, Storage)                  |
| **Handlers**         | Just functions or static orchestrators that implement use-cases |
| **Output Port**      | Delegate passed into use case to abstract side-effects          |
| **Core**             | Pure logic: types, validators, calculators, etc.                |

## üí≠ Philosophy

PASTA is an architectural style for modern .NET (and beyond) projects that favors:

* Functionally cohesive, vertically sliced designs

* Delegate-based composition over interface-based ceremony

* Clear separation between core logic and I/O without overengineering

PASTA takes inspiration from Hexagonal Architecture, Functional Core/Imperative Shell, and Vertical Slice Architecture, but distills them into a leaner, practical style.

## ü™∂PASTA Manifesto

> "Layered systems are like overcooked spaghetti ‚Äî sticky, tangled, and a pain to digest. PASTA serves it al dente."

### ‚ùå No More Overengineering

* Interfaces are not sacred. Use delegates, records, and lambdas instead.

* DI containers should wire up dependencies, not define your architecture.

* Fewer layers, more clarity. Logic lives where it belongs.

### ‚úÖ Embrace Simplicity with Power

* Functional core for business rules ‚Äî pure, testable, composable.

* Imperative shell for wiring, I/O, and coordination.

* Keep logic close to where it‚Äôs used with vertical slices.

### üì¶ Ports & Adapters Done Right

* Ports are typed function signatures, not interfaces.

* Adapters are infrastructure implementations of these ports.

* In tests, replace ports with pure functions. No mocking frameworks needed.

### üß© Service Handlers: Explicit and Focused

* No base classes, no magic.

* Everything needed is passed via constructor (record positional args).

* Handlers can be composed and reused.

### üß† Typed Abstractions Over Interfaces

* Prefer discriminated unions, result types, and domain primitives.

* Abstractions should describe what not how.

* Treat functions as first-class citizens.

```csharp
public delegate Task SaveBooking(Core.Domain.Booking booking);
public delegate Task<Result<Booking, BookingError>> GetBooking(Guid bookingId);
```

### üß™ Test by Design

* No need for mocks when logic is in pure functions.

* Test core logic in isolation.

* Service handlers are easy to test with hand-written or inline dependencies.

## üéØ Testing Strategies

| Test Type           | Scope                                    | What to Stub                                         | Purpose                                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Tests**      | `Core` + optionally `Handlers`           | Everything (Ports, Adapters, I/O)                    | Pure logic, correctness, no side effects                   |
| **Component Tests** | `Use Case ‚Üí Handlers ‚Üí Adapters (owned)` | Only 3rd-party/external adapters (e.g. SMTP, Stripe) | Verify application behavior across multiple layers/modules |


## Unit testing
PASTA enforces unit testing for Core (pure domain logic: rules, validations, calculations)
and Handlers (if they orchestrate logic without side effects). The goal is to test **individual
behaviors in isolation and ensure logic correctness unders all conditions**.

It should be fast, deterministic, no I/O

## Component testing

PASTA encourages component testing for full use case execution ‚Äî 
from API adapter through handlers, core, and owned adapters.
The goal is to verify the behavior **of a complete vertical slice of the system with real infrastructure components** (e.g. in-memory DB, message broker),
while **stubbing only external dependencies you don‚Äôt own** (e.g. 3rd-party APIs, SMTP).
It ensures correctness across integrated parts you control, with realistic I/O and boundary behavior.

## </> Sample Code

### ü•¶ PastaFit - Functional Booking System with PASTA (.NET 9)

PastaFit is a sample application demonstrating the PASTA architecture in a real-world fitness domain: a booking system for gym classes.
It uses:
- [x] Functional primitives with `FunqTypes.Result<T, E>`
- [x] No interfaces ‚Äì just function delegates and records
- [x] No layers ‚Äì just Features, Ports, Shell, and Domain
- [x] Concise and expressive handlers
- [x] Testability and separation without overengineering

üì¶ Domain: Booking gym classes

- **Booking** ‚Äì links a Member to a Class
- **Class** ‚Äì has name and limited capacity
- **Member** ‚Äì can be active/inactive

### üìà Architecture

| Layer                 | Responsibility                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**            | Core data types (`Booking`, `Class`, `BookingError`) |
| **Features**          | Use case logic (e.g. `CreateBookingHandler`)         |
| **Contracts (Ports)** | Delegates like `GetClass`, `SaveBooking`, etc.       |
| **Infrastructure**    | In-memory adapters, bootstrapping                    |
| **Shell**             | Minimal API endpoints and DI glue                    |


### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```shell
dotnet run --project src/PastaFit
```
Then open http://localhost:5247 and use the .http file or run curl commands.

### üì° API Endpoints

| Method | Route            | Description                 |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| GET    | `/classes`       | List classes + availability |
| GET    | `/members`       | List all members            |
| POST   | `/bookings`      | Create booking              |
| DELETE | `/bookings/{id}` | Cancel booking              |
